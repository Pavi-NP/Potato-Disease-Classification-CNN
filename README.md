# Potato-Disease-Image_Classification-CNN
<small> *This project is intended for practicing Git and GitHub usage, inspired by codebasics's YouTube tutorial on Potato Disease Classification* </small>

## Overview
This repository hosts a machine learning project aimed at classifying images of potato plants affected by two common diseases: early blight disease and late blight disease. By leveraging deep learning techniques, we seek to develop an accurate classification model capable of identifying these diseases from images captured in potato fields.
## Motivation
Potato diseases, such as early blight and late blight, can have significant economic implications for farmers and agricultural industries. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of these diseases are essential for implementing timely intervention strategies to mitigate crop losses. This project aims to provide a reliable and automated tool for identifying potato diseases, aiding in crop management and decision-making processes.
## Features
Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification.
Preprocessing techniques to enhance image quality and normalize pixel values.
Training, validation, and testing pipelines to evaluate model performance.
Deployment of the trained model for real-time classification of potato disease images.

## Practice Repository

This project is created as a practice exercise to learn and apply Git and GitHub usage. It is inspired by codebasics's YouTube tutorial on Deep Learning for Potato Disease Classification.
